This folder contains the files necessary to implement a Variable Block Size Motion Estimation (VBSME) using mips instructions. 
The VBSME is a search pattern that scans through an image to find a specified window. It uses Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) to find a window within a picture.
This code uses matrices with numbers rather than actual picture pixels. 

Collaboration between David Polk, Richardo Larez, and Paz Davila.
